| General topic ? | The researchers describes how the aging process is managed by post-transcriptional mechanisms, a modification after reading the gene, and how these mechanisms could extend our life span.
| Procedure/what was examined? | They used small nematode worms that are genetically close to humans and have a very limited lifespan then they used data analysis to compare the genes between the worms on which they imposed normal feeding on some worms and limited feeding on others. This caloric restriction is a process of dietary restriction which is very effective in prolonging life and delaying the onset of degenerative disease. 
| Conclusions/discovery ? | The discovery of post-transcription mechanisms will make it possible to chart a path towards drugs that could have positive effects on longevity About 100 genes that were responsible for the longevity process were modified by post-transcriptional mechanisms, whereas these genes were not known to play this role. Through the discovery of these roles we may learn more about how dietary restriction can extends life span.
