| General topic ? | The behaviour of dogs of different breeds would be in part closely related to genetic differences 
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers used a survey that more than 50,000 owners of pets have filled out. The behavior data are based on 14 behavorial factors giving a measure of traits like energy level, stranger-directed aggression, excitability, and predatory chasing drive. They pulled 14,020 of those entries that contained information about pure-bred dogs. To search for associations with genetics they took data from two other studies, together counting 5,697 dogs. Then, they managed to sequence 172,000 points in the genome.
| Conclusions/discovery ? |  They found out that about half of the variation among the 14 measured behaviors between each breed could be caused by genetics. There are traits which have a higher rate of heritability, so which are linked by genetics. These traits are capacity of training, predatory chasing, stranger-directed aggression, and predatory chasing. About 60 to 70 percent of variations between races are explained by genetics for these traits.
