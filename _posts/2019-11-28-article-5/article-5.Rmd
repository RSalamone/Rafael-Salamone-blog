| General topic ? | Cryptic genetic variants are what cause evolutionary leaps and these could allow new biomolecules to be found in the medical field or other fields
| Procedure/what was examined? | Step one, they took bacteria from the gut and mutated it with a mutagenic PCD. The bacteria multiplied by donating their plasmids and then they chose the ones that synthesized a yellow protein. Then, as a second step, they took the bacteria that synthesized green proteins
| Conclusions/discovery ? | These cryptic genetic variants could make it possible to develop new biomolecular techniques. For example, it could cause a biomolecule to bind to a new receptor
| Remaining questions | /
