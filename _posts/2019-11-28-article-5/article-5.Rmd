step throat | an infection of the back of the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus | angine
to cloak | to hide | cacher
uncharacterized | not characterized | non caractérisé 
to engulf | to cover | engloutir
phagocytic immune cells | cells which use its plasma membrane to engulf a large particle, giving rise to an internal compartment called the phagosome | cellules immunitaires phagocytaires
overlooke | neglected | négligé
virulence factor | molecules produced by bacteria that add to their effectiveness and enable them to achieve the colonization of a niche in the host | facteur de virulence
scarlet fever | contagious disease with rash | scarlatine
elusive | out of reach | hors de portée
penicillin | penicillins are a group of antibacterial drugs that attack a broad range of bacteria
immune clearance | the accelerated removal of an antigen from the bloodstream that follows the initiation of an antibody response by the immune system. This leads to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, which are ingested by macrophages and other phagocytic cells
bacterial strain | a genetic variant or subtype of a bacteria | souche bactérienne
macrophages | a large white blood cell in the immune system that destroys bacteria and other harmful substances | macrophages
neutrophils | a phagocytic white blood cell having a lobulate nucleus and neutrophil granules in the cytoplasm | neutrophiles
moreover | additionally
molecular mimicry | analogy between a self antigen and certain structures of a pathogen

| Published in ? | ScienceDaily, December 3, 2019
| General topic ? | Discover of a protein specific to the bacteria that mainly causes strep throat. This protein called protein S gives the bacteria a better ability to hide from the immune system by binding with red blood cells.
| Procedure/what was examined? | They used a nanotechnology-based technique called virulome-based biomimetics to find out which protein is used to bind the bacteria to dead red blood cells. 
| Conclusions/discovery ? | They have discovered that bacterial strains that do not possess protein S are less virulent and deadly. Thanks to this discovery, researchers are on the trail of a novel vaccine candidate.
