| General topic ? | People with genetic variations would be more susceptible to telephone radiation causing thyroid cancer.
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers looked at a number of genes and focused on four of them. When these genes get SNPs, they are more likely to cause thyroid cancer.
| Conclusions/discovery ? | Genetic susceptibilities (SNPs) play an important role in the development of thyroid cancers and this may help to identify groups of people who are at higher risk of developing them.
| Remaining questions | It is necessary to redo a more in-depth study but with much more recent data because the data for this study dates back to the beginning of smartphones
