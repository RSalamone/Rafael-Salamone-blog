| General topic ? | Researchers have discovered that dodders, a type of parasitic plant, use genes from their host to better extract their nutrients 
| Procedure/what was examined? | 118 genes were added to the dodder genome by horizontal gene transfer contributing to the structure of the haustoria and other things. They used several criteria to see if these substilized genes would be functional: the genes would be long, contain all the required parts of a gene, be able to be transcribed into arn and present relevant structures. 
| Conclusions/discovery ? | 1) 18 of the 118 genes were already present in the ancestors of the cuscates present today and this has strongly contributed to their proliferation. 2) Some mutations do not impact the function of the gene and therefore the formation of the protein encoded by this gene. We see that the selection tries to keep the protein intact and usable.
| Remaining questions | 1) How genetic material is transferred from the host to the parasite and is this transfer one-way or can it sometimes be in both directions ? 2) Can horizontal gene transfer also occur between other plant species and even between non-parasitic plants or other organisms as complex as this one ?
