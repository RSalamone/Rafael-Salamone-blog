| General topic ? | Researchers have discovered that dodders, a type of parasitic plant, use genes from their host to better extract their nutrients 
| Procedure/what was examined? | 
| Conclusions/discovery ? | 
| Remaining questions | 1) How genetic material is transferred from the host to the parasite and is this transfer one-way or can it sometimes be in both directions ? 2) Can horizontal gene transfer also occur between other plant species and even between non-parasitic plants or other organisms as complex as this one ?
