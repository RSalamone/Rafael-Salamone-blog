| Published in ? | ScienceDaily, October 10, 2019
| General topic ?| How koala epidemic can help us to understand the way koala succeeded to protect itself from viruses.
| Procedure/what was examined? | They examined how KoRV-A, a retrovirus which sweeps through the wild population, infects germ cells of koalas. 
| Conclusions/discovery ? | Koalas develop an innate genome immune system that can distinguish a virus from one of their genes. Germ cells recognize an indispensable step in the viral life cycle and turn it against the intruder to eliminate genome infection. 
| Remaining questions | How the virus got into the germline ? A better understanding of the process of cutting the unspliced RNA transcripts in order to they are no longer functional ?
